### Murders 

It is our first project named *Preparing for a Data Science Project*. We want to create two subdirectories to hold the raw data and intermediate data. We'll call these:

* data 
* rda (R Data)

We need two scripts to load data:

* download-data.R: it's a script to download the file into  the data directory for remote server.
* wrangle-data.R: it's a script to read this data and prepare a table that we can use for further analysis. This file is saved in rda directory. Although not the case here, this approach is often practical because generating the data object we use for final analysis and plots can be complex and time consuming. So we run this process one time and save the file.
